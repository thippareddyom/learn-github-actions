AI and git Actions Demo
=======================

1) Project quick intro
- Two parts: Flask backend (`ark_list_web_service`) and React/Vite frontend (`ark_list_web_app`).
- Data sources: public data from ARK/Yahoo, and price/indicator JSONs (`*_stocks_data.json`, `*_etf_data.json`).
- local LLM (GGUF) for AI ideas; deterministic fallback if model missing/disabled.
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD.

2) Live flow (what to show)
- Funds dashboard: shows all ARK funds with YTD gains; click a fund to see holdings snapshot (auto-downloads `<SYMBOL>-holdings.json` if missing).
- Matrix view: weights of each ticker across funds with sorting; tickers are clickable to open charts.
- Ticker List: ordered by total weight; selecting a ticker shows chart, 21-day MA, RSI mini-panel, and “Latest snapshot” card (open/high/low/close/MA/RSI/MACD/ATR).
- AI Recommendation panel: fetches `/ai/bulk-recommendation`, shows top 3 bullish setups in a table; tickers are clickable to jump to chart.

3) AI capability
- Endpoint: `/ai/bulk-recommendation` returns `recommendation`, `prompt`, and structured `rows`.
- Local LLM (GGUF in `data/models`) used when present; otherwise deterministic fallback supplies the table/text.
- Frontend renders the table, links to tickers, and keeps working even if the model is absent.

4) Data handling
- Funds metadata: `ark-urls.json`.
- Holdings: `<SYMBOL>-holdings.json` (auto-downloaded on first request if missing).
- Price history: `*_stocks_data.json` and `*_etf_data.json` include indicators (SMA/RSI/MACD/ATR).
- Latest row is exposed via `/tickers/<symbol>/history` as `latest` for the report card.

5) CI/CD overview
- GitHub Actions: `.github/workflows/build.yml` builds frontend + backend and uploads a `dist/` artifact (web + service).
- `scripts/pack.sh` packages both locally into `dist/` (prunes large model file, writes `requirements.lock.txt`).
- Deploy: placeholder workflow `deply.yml` can be adapted to sync `dist/` to a server.

6) How to run locally
- Backend: `cd ark_list_web_service && pip install -r requirements.txt && python app.py` (port 5000).
- Frontend: `cd ark_list_web_app && npm ci && npm run dev` (port 5173).
- Build frontend: `npm run build`; packaged under `dist/web`.

7) Talking points (demo script)
- Start at Funds page, click a fund → holdings table, note auto-download if file missing.
- Toggle Matrix → show sorting and ticker links.
- Toggle Ticker List → select a ticker → chart with MA, RSI, latest snapshot card.
- Show AI Recommendation → table with top tickers, click one → chart updates.
- Mention fallback behavior when LLM absent and that bulk recs still render.

8) Limitations / caveats
- Large GGUF models are not in git; place under `data/models/` manually.
- If indicators are NaN in the latest data, bulk “rows” may be sparse; rerun data download.
- `deply.yml` is a stub; adapt for your deployment target.
